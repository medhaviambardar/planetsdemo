Mars is great. It is red and small.
But it is uninhabitable for human life. Also, there are probably 
Martians.
Also, it is too far away
I would like to go there one day. But not today.
My favorite Martian is Marvin because he likes kabooms (earth-shattering 
kabooms).
Just wanted to edit the file.
